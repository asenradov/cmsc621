To compile the code, run ./compile
Run the programs in the following order in different terminals.(This way works the best)
./frontGate Configs/frontGateConfig.txt Outputs/frontGateLog.txt
./backGate Configs/backGateConfig.txt Outputs/backLog.txt
./device Configs/deviceConfig.txt Outputs/deviceLog.txt
./sensor Configs/keyConfig.txt Inputs/keyInput.txt Outputs/keyOutput.txt 
./sensor Configs/motionConfig.txt Inputs/motionInput.txt Outputs/motionOutput.txt
./sensor Configs/doorConfig.txt Inputs/doorInput.txt Outputs/doorOutput.txt

Alternatively you could run the script ./system.sh
the logs will be logged in the Outputs folder
If run this way, kill the process by getting the pid of the programs with ps.
It is best to kill the sensors then the device and finally the backGate and frontGate
