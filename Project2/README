I've got special permission to change the config file.
The config files for the 3 sensors will be
"keySensor,motionSensor and doorSensor" instead of just sensor.

Assumptions
-A door open will be followed by a door close.
-If the first time in the input for all sensors is 0 then the messages could be recieved in any order.
-The backgate will log registering of devices only if the registering happened after the backgate is run.

The algorithm that the program uses differs from the example algorithm provided in the pdf and was approved by Sandeep. The close signals the next motion and key to be recorded. Thus the outputs would differ as such:

My algorithm:
 Door Close
 motion = false
 key = false
 -User left
 
Descriptor:
 motion = true
 key = true
 door open
 motion = false
 key =false
 -User left

Message Formats.
Messages will be past between the multichannel and the uni channel
BackGate is not part of the multichannel

Everything to Multicast
-------------------------------------
currValue (Multichannel)
	Type:currValue;Action:clock(comma seperated)-id-state-type

Multicast to Gateway
-------------------------------
register (Unichannel)
	Type:register;Action:clock-deviceType-ip-port

Front Gate to Back Gate
-------------------------
insert (Unichannel)
	Type:insert;Action:id,deviceType,deviceValue,clock,ip,port


Gateway to doorSensor
-------------------------
poll
	Type:currState;Action:poll;

Gateway to Device
-------------------------
switch
	Type:switch;Action:on;

Gateway to Sensors
------------------------
clear
	Type:clear;Action:deviceNum-numDevices(5);
