It is important to note that there is one device file which can act as both the sensor process and deivce process.

How to use the file and run the programs are given in Instructions.txt.

I will not include a SampleTextRun.txt on how to run the SampleInput because it is explained in Instructions.txt

It is important that the text files are in proper format. (No extra blank lines)

If you have any questions contact me at tong2@umbc.edu
For example: In a situation with two sensors and an area, the device can turn off if one sensor goes above 34 and the other sensor has a reading of 32 or above.
I feel that the requested level of output is inadequate. Feel free to uncomment any debugging statements
